    <h2>What is MUN?</h2>
    <p><span class="illumination">M</span>odel United Nations, also known as MUN, is an international format of debate
where young individuals take part in simulations of the United Nations by
representing different countries and NGOs/IGOS in different committees that
debate a range of relevant issues. This activity takes place at MUN conferences,
which are usually organized by a secondary school or university/college
MUN club.</p>

<p>Through travelling to other countries, meeting students from many other schools
with different cultures, collaborating and working with them during the day and
socialising with them in the evenings, students expand their knowledge and
experience of different cultures, leading to a greater awareness of diversity and
an increase in global mindedness.</p>
<p>Other benefits of participation for students include:
 - improving critical thinking, research and writing skills, 
- increasing self confidence through public speaking and debating,
- practice in working collaboratively,
- increase in knowledge of world/ current affairs,
- excellent experience to add to personal statements when applying to further
education institutions and / or on some job applications.</p>

    news and issues with an international dimension. Through research and
    discussions we consciously aim to be aware of and to try to understand multiple
    viewpoints on issues.
