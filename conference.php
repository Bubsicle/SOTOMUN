    <p>Dear Guest,</p>
    <p>It is our pleasure to invite you and your school to participate in our international MUN conference to be held in
      our school in Sotogrande, a vast estate located on the Mediterranean coast of southern Spain. Please see
      <a href="http://sis.ac">www.sis.ac</a> for more information about the school and its location.
      <br><span class="bold">The conference will start on Thursday 20 th and finish on Sunday 23 rd September.</span></p>
      <p>Students from SIS have been participating in MUN conferences for many years, however this will be our first
        time as the host school.
        We plan to have 3 committees of approximately 25-30 delegates each; and although only one of these is a
        traditional GA committee, all 3 committees will come together for a General Assembly session on Sunday
        morning.
        &#40;Note. It will be possible to add a further committee if the number of applicants exceeds expectations.&#41;</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Travel, accommodation &amp; transport logistics</h2>
        <p>Sotogrande is some 90 kilometers west of Malaga airport and 20 kilometers east of Gibraltar airport.
          It may be possible for us to arrange for you to be collected at airport &#40;small additional charge&#41; once we know
          your flight times, otherwise our team will be happy to advise on best onward travel options.</p>

          <p>There is no convenient public transport link serving Sotogrande International School, so as part of our package,
            we will be providing coach transport to and from the school for all 4 days of the conference.</p>

            <p>As Sotogrande itself does not have much of a centre, we would like to suggest that schools look for
              accommodation in Estepona, a coastal town with beautiful beaches approximately 30km east of Sotogrande.
              Our coach transport will start from there in the mornings, a journey time of approximately 30 minutes,
              assuming not too many different pick up points en route.
              Unfortunately we are unable to provide host accommodation, but please do not hesitate to contact us if you
              would like our help with finding an appropriate hotel.</p>
