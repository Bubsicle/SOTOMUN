    <h2>Travel, accommodation & transport logistics</h2>
    <p>Sotogrande is some 90 kilometers west of Malaga airport and 20 kilometers east of Gibraltar airport. For participants from outside Spain, it may be possible for us to arrange for you to be collected at airport  (additional charge) once we know your flight times, otherwise our team will be happy to advise on best onward travel options.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately we are unable to provide host family accommodation, but please do not hesitate to contact us if you would like our help with finding an appropriate hotel. As Sotogrande itself does not have much of a centre, we would like to suggest that schools look for accommodation in Estepona, a coastal town with beautiful beaches approximately 30km east of Sotogrande.  Depending on numbers, we hope to be able to arrange some special deals with some of the hotels (more information later) and also daily coach transport ( additional charge) to and from there to the school, a journey time of approximately 30 minutes, assuming not too many different pick up points en route.</p>

          your flight times, otherwise our team will be happy to advise on best onward travel options.</p>

          <p>There is no convenient public transport link serving Sotogrande International School, so as part of our package,
            we will be providing coach transport to and from the school for all 4 days of the conference.</p>

            <p>As Sotogrande itself does not have much of a centre, we would like to suggest that schools look for
              accommodation in Estepona, a coastal town with beautiful beaches approximately 30km east of Sotogrande.
              Our coach transport will start from there in the mornings, a journey time of approximately 30 minutes,
              assuming not too many different pick up points en route.
