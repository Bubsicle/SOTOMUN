        <h2 class="mt-4">Travel, accommodation &amp; transport logistics</h2>
        <p>Sotogrande is some 90 kilometers west of Malaga airport and 20 kilometers east of Gibraltar airport.
          It may be possible for us to arrange for you to be collected at airport &#40;small additional charge&#41; once we know
          your flight times, otherwise our team will be happy to advise on best onward travel options.</p>

          <p>There is no convenient public transport link serving Sotogrande International School, so as part of our package,
            we will be providing coach transport to and from the school for all 4 days of the conference.</p>

            <p>As Sotogrande itself does not have much of a centre, we would like to suggest that schools look for
              accommodation in Estepona, a coastal town with beautiful beaches approximately 30km east of Sotogrande.
              Our coach transport will start from there in the mornings, a journey time of approximately 30 minutes,
              assuming not too many different pick up points en route.
              Unfortunately we are unable to provide host accommodation, but please do not hesitate to contact us if you
              would like our help with finding an appropriate hotel.</p>
